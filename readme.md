# GameServersHub - Framework Discord Bot

###### This discord bot is 100% FREE and OPEN source for the public to use to track and monitor real time website resource updates.

An official discord bot that server admins and owners can use to pull real-time website data directly into their discord. [Website Marketplace](https://gameservershub.com) created this bot for the popular "[Ark Survival Evolved](https://store.steampowered.com/app/346110/ARK_Survival_Evolved/)" framework, allowing server owners to host plugins on their gaming servers.

## What is "Ark Survival Evolved"?:

Stranded on the shores of a mysterious island, you must learn to survive. Use your cunning to kill or tame the primeval creatures roaming the land, and encounter other players to survive, dominate... and escape! As a man or woman stranded naked, freezing and starving on the shores of a mysterious island called ARK, you must hunt, harvest resources, craft items, grow crops, research technologies, and build shelters to withstand the elements. Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame & breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape!

## What is "ArkServerAPI" or "ServerAPI" framework?:

This tool allows you to load plugins into your gaming communities; this is an open-source community-supported "**API**" required for server admins to load server plugins and resources correctly.

- The API will generate log files in this location "ShooterGame/Win64/logs/ArkApi.log"
- The API has built-in crash logs, which can be located inside "ShooterGame/Saved/Logs/"
- The API has no connection or affiliation with "Wildcard Studios" directly, nor should it ever be considered that "Wildcard Studios" endorses the API. The API is an open-source tool the community can use to run plugins for their video game servers, similar to how "Minecraft / Rust" and other video games have plugin systems where you can improve the overall health and gameplay of your community servers.
- Please note when installing plugins into the "ARK\ShooterGame\Binaries\Win64\ArkApi\Plugins" folder, you must make sure the ".DLL" plugin name matches the same "folder" name.
- Changing the folder name to something different or unique will prevent the ".DLL" from reading the folder and preventing it from starting.
- You may join our "discord server" if you have any questions/feedback or want general support regarding ArkServerAPI.

## What does this discord bot do exactly?:

This discord bot allows server admins and owners who use the "**ServerAPI**" framework to take view real time stats inside their private or public discord communities where they can track and minitor plugins or resource updates from the website. This is helpful when server owners want to always keep their content up to date.
